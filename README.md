Machine Leaning 
===============

*"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task 
T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."*

<h1>Welcome!</h1>

This is a repository to test some concepts of machine learning according to the course of [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/course/ml) by Coursera. The course is ministered by [Andrew Ng](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/ang/) from Stanford.

Some concepts of Machine Learning terms are explained in each folder, feel free to take a look, and for use these codes you must install Octave([download here](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/download.html)) or MatLab([download here](http://www.mathworks.com/downloads/web_downloads/?s_tid=hp_ff_s_downloads)).
I prefer Octave because is free, but both works fine.

Machine Learning Algorithms

	- Supervised learning
	- Unsupervised learning

<h1>Unsupervised Learning</h1>
This algorithm of machine learning find data structures for us, there is no need to exist labels of the datas, it learn by itself.
