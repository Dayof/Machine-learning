One Feature or Univariate Linear Regression

For a feature, the linear regression algorithm needs a training set of the data, the "inputs" and the values of the "outputs", than, we apply these datas in the hipothesis function, ```h_(theta) (x) = theta_(0) + theta_(1) * x```. 

In others words, if for example, we want to predict the estimated price for a house by its size, you will need a training set of inputs of sizes of many houses and the estimated price of them, and according with these values you represent the hipothesis function, and choose theta0 and theta1 so that htheta(x) is close to y for our training examples (x, y).

<h1>Cost Function</h1>
This function let us figure out how to fit the best possible straight line to our data. The hypothesis function make predictions in this linear function.
